## Full Narration Script

[Voice: Professional, trustworthy, slight urgency]

> "SMS fraud costs Colombian families millions each year. Elderly users are especially vulnerable to sophisticated phishing attacks impersonating banks and services they trust.
>
> TuGuardian provides automatic, real-time protection by analyzing incoming SMS messages locally on the device. When a fraudulent message arrives, we detect it instantly - blocking dangerous links before any harm occurs.
>
> This protection is only possible with READ_SMS permission - it's not an auxiliary feature, it's our core functionality. Without access to SMS content, fraud detection becomes impossible.
>
> Importantly, we process everything locally. No SMS ever leave the device. No servers, no cloud storage, complete privacy.
>
> READ_SMS permission is essential for TuGuardian to protect vulnerable users from financial fraud. It's not a convenience - it's a necessity for security.
>
> TuGuardian - protecting Colombian families through privacy-first, local intelligence."
